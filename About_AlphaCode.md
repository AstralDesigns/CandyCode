# About CandyCode

CandyCode is a cutting-edge Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed for the development, testing, and deployment of autonomous AI agents. It provides a robust suite of tools that allow developers to build agents capable of complex reasoning, tool usage, and autonomous task execution.

## Key Features

- **Agentic Behavior**: Agents in CandyCode are designed to be autonomous, using function calls to interact with the environment and solve problems without constant human intervention.
- **Integrated Tooling**: Built-in support for file operations, shell execution, web searching, and code analysis.
- **Dynamic Task Tracking**: Real-time planning and task management capabilities allow agents to adapt to new information and changing requirements.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Support for building and managing workflows involving multiple specialized agents.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work with modern automation platforms and cloud services.

## Why CandyCode?

CandyCode bridges the gap between static code and dynamic, goal-oriented AI. By providing agents with a rich set of tools and a structured environment, it enables the creation of AI systems that can truly "act" rather than just "respond."
